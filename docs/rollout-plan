# Rollout Plan (Phased)

## Phase 0 – Discovery

- 8–10 interviews with VPs/Directors of Eng and DevEx leaders at companies
  already piloting Copilot.
- Validate which metrics and guardrails matter most.
- Align with GitHub security/compliance teams on constraints.

## Phase 1 – Alpha (Read-only Analytics)

- Implement basic telemetry ingestion and aggregation.
- Ship an internal dashboard for 3–5 design-partner orgs.
- Success: leaders log in weekly and use the data in their planning.

## Phase 2 – Policies & Nudges

- Introduce a small set of policy templates:
  - Allow / block repos
  - Require tests when AI diff > X%
  - Require code-owner review for AI-heavy changes
- Surface policy status in IDE and PRs.
- Measure:
  - Policy adoption
  - Developer sentiment (surveys)
  - Changes in coverage / incidents.

## Phase 3 – Enterprise Hardening

- Fine-grained RBAC, audit logging, and SOC2-ready controls.
- Deeper integrations with GitHub Advanced Security and compliance tooling.
- Pricing & packaging experiments for enterprise customers.
