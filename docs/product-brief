# Product Brief – GitHub Copilot for Teams

## Background

GitHub Copilot today is optimized for **individual developer productivity**.
Enterprise customers increasingly ask questions that Copilot does not answer
well:

- “Is this improving or hurting code quality across our org?”
- “How do we roll it out safely in regulated repos?”
- “How do we justify the spend to finance and security?”

## Problem Statement

Engineering leaders lack **visibility, control, and proof** around Copilot
usage at the org level, which slows adoption and expansion.

## Users

- VP / Director of Engineering
- DevEx / Platform Engineering leads
- Staff / Principal engineers
- Security / Compliance partners

## Goals

- Increase safe Copilot adoption across teams
- Provide credible metrics that support expansion / renewal
- Reduce security and compliance risk from AI-generated code
- Standardize best practices across an org

## Out of Scope (initially)

- Changing the core suggestion model
- Non-GitHub ecosystems (GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
- Per-developer performance ranking (to avoid surveillance concerns)
